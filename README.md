## Description

#### English

##### Primary Application description : 

your ads. I wrote this app for my own usage and it is still not perfect. It may contain bugs but I do not have the time at the moment to finish this app. As it was just lying around on my harddisk I thought perhaps someone likes to use it so here it is. It works for me but is not very user-friendly. The app does not send any data anywhere else than the AdMob server. Take a look at the sourcecode if you want to be sure. If you like to continue this app please contact me: admobmanager -at- omoco -dot- de
